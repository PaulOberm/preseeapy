# preseeapy

This package is used to grab data from the spanish linguistic corpus PRESEEA 
and generate a basic report from it. The generated report is a .csv file.
The aim is to rapidly retrieve data in a structured format on the researchers
computer for further linguistic investigation. The researcher should be able
to concentrate on a language model instead of copying that data from the Browser.
Some basic analyses are done as well and added to the report.
